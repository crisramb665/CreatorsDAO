    AIMING AT TRUE DECENTRALIZATION (*La palabra true debe ir en un tamaño un poco más grande, otro color, en negrilla y/o algún distintivo adicional) => Title 

    The decentralization narrative preached so often in crypto is not very real, despite being build on decentralized blockchains, more than 95% of projects are thought, planned, created and managed by a very small group of individuals. Yes, governance has been a game changer allowing users to have their voice heard, but very rarely the community's ideas are transformed into fully functional products by the development teams. => P1

    We want to transition to a model where complete decentralization is eventually achieved, a model that from the selection of ideas to their final implementation is led almost entirely by the community. => P2

    You propose, we create. => Title

    YOUR VOTE COUNTS => Title

SECTION #2: 
    Retroactive Token Airdrop => Title

    We'll have our own governance token which will be used as voting power and aditionally will grant special benefits to it's holders in every single product and protocol deployed by **Dao Games. 
    The distribution will be done through a retroactive aidrop method, different percentages will be sent to all qualifying active users, investors, collaborators, core development team and finally the community treasury.=> P1
