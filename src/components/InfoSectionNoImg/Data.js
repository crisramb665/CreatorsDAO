  description:
    "The decentralization narrative preached so often in crypto is not very real, despite being build on decentralized blockchains, more than 95% of projects are thought, planned, created and managed by a very small group of individuals. Yes, governance has been a game changer allowing users to have their voice heard, but very rarely the community's ideas are transformed into fully functional products by the development teams.",
  description2: 
    "We want to transition to a model where complete decentralization is eventually achieved, a model that from the selection of ideas to their final implementation is led almost entirely by the community.",
