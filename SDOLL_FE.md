Experiment
SECTION #1 
Welcome to a new paradigm in social tokens, we've crafted a unique system that rewards proportionally, fairly and evenly all users who decide to participate in the Squid Doll Game. 
We are committed to explore the proof-of-game concepts and take them to the next level, here you will find that fair distribution was never this fair!  
SECTION #1.1 o #2 
This project comes from the collective behind **Creators Dao, a passionate group of experienced developers and crypto enthusiasts motivated to push the boundaries on what's possible in the crypto-social industry.

SECTION #2
Tokenomics.
A total of 456,000,000 SDOLL tokens have been minted (symbolically representing the fisrt 456 players of the game), this is also the Total Max Supply as the SDOLL token contract code does not allow to mint any more tokens beyond than number, 97.5% of this supply has been deposited into the token smart contract this means that no developer, user, or external agent will have access to this funds, ONLY the smart contract itself, just 2.5% of this supply will be used to sell on the open market, provide liqudity, promote the community development, and for marketing purposes. 

SECTION  #2.1
Our model is very unique, it mimics a seed-to-tree dynamic which works by allowing investors to grow a big tree over time just by buying a small seed and participating in the games, put in another words the 97.5% (excluding the tokens that will be burned, more info belowâ†“) will be automatically distributed among the winners who hold a portion of the initial 2.5% (the seed. 
SDOLL is also a governance token, that will allow users to vote for the game settings they prefer as well as access to unique benefits in all future projects deployed by **Creators Dao. 

#SECTION #3
Perpetual Burning deflactionary mechanism.
We've developed carefully a simple yet beautiful deflactionary model, for every game played up to 90% of the game reward will be burned, this ensures a constant decrease in the total SDOLL supply, it will be up to the community to decide how much of the total supply is burned in every round.

Game mechanics: => Title
FE - FE - FE - FE - FE - FE - FE - FE - FE - FE - FE
The mechanics are very simple, we invite users to participate to each round but it's always up to them if they want to play the game or not meaning that participation is COMPLETELY optional. 
For each game there will be a start block (red light) and an end block (green light) which will be different for each game depending on what the devs and community decide, once the start block takes place the game will be officially started, as soon as this happens a snapshot of each participant SDOLL balance will be taken, when the end block takes place there will be another snapshot taken reflecting the final SDOLL balance held by each participant, in order for participants to win, their SDOLL balance has to remain exactly the same for the duration of each game right until the end.  
Once each game is finished the total reward will be distributed among all winners proportionally to what they held. The more you hold the more you earn, but if you move, you loose! => P1

For each game there will be a start block (red light) and an end block (green light) which will be different for each game depending on what the devs and community decide (this can be seen in the main page of the project), once the start block takes place the game will be officially started, as soon as this happens a snapshot of each participant SDOLL balance will be taken, when the end block takes place there will be another snapshot taken reflecting the final SDOLL balance held by each participant, in order for participants to win, their SDOLL balance has to remain exactly the same for the duration of each game right until the end, be aware that random snapshots will be taken between the start of the game and the end of the game ensuring only the holders who remained still are rewarded. Once each game is finished the total reward will be distributed among all winners proportionally to what they held. The more you hold the more you earn, but if you move, you loose! 


How to participate:
If you wish to participate just head to the main page of the project, then go to the "Game information" section, there you'll find:
-If there is already an ongoing game or not 
-What's the minimum participation balance
-If participant registration is open or not
-What's the start and end block of the current or upcoming game
-What is the total prize for the ongoing or upcoming game
If participant registration is open and you have more than the minimum balance required to participate then look for the "Participate" button, if you wish to participate simply click it and confirm your participation in your wallet, after that you'll be automatically participating on the following game.

How do you win the games:
Once you registered as a participant you just have to keep your balance in you wallet from the start block to the end block without moving it not even 1 SDOLL token, if you accomplish this you will automatically win and receive the funds in your wallet. 

Are there extra prizes?
YES! We've prepared some Squid Doll themed NFTs that will be given to users winning on consecutive rounds, there will be a wide range of prizes for a wide range of users, for instance users winning 10 consecutive rounds will get an entry type of NFT while users winning 50 consecutive rounds will get a limited edition NFT. These NFTs will also grant special benefits for all future crypto games developed by the Creators Dao collective.
